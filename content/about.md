# About gitfit.xyz

Hello and welcome to **gitfit.xyz!**

I'm Jeff Meendering, the creator of this website. My journey with gitfit.xyz is twofold - it's about sharing my passion for fitness and learning about Hugo, a static site generator written in Go.

# My Mission

I believe in the power of exercise to transform lives. It's not just about being physically fit; it's about the overall wellbeing. Through gitfit.xyz, I aim to share general workout advice that has helped me and can potentially benefit others. This platform is also my playground for mastering web development skills, particularly with Hugo.

# What You'll Find Here

- Weekly Workout Routines: I'll share workout routines that I've found effective. These will be diverse, catering to various fitness levels and goals.
- Exercise Tips: Expect tips and insights on exercising effectively and safely, based on my experiences and learning.
- My Learning Journey: As I delve deeper into Hugo and web development, I'll share my insights and progress. It's about growing together in both fitness and knowledge.

# About My Passion

I have always been passionate about technology and exercise. Combining these two seemed like a natural step. By building gitfit.xyz, I'm not just creating a platform for others to learn about fitness; I'm also enhancing my own skills and understanding in a field I'm equally passionate about - technology.

# Let's Connect

I'm always excited to interact with like-minded individuals who share a passion for fitness and technology.
